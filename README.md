# About EasyArea

This project was inspired by *EasyExpertise*, a ReactNative Mobile App developped in collaboration with three classmate for a graduation group project.

EasyArea is a Web App and you only need a web browser to use it. So far, it is not connected to a DB and it does not use or store any private data.

Its main purpose is to calculate surface area based on simple geometrical shapes setted by the user. It also provides an estimation of paint quantity required to cover the project surface area.

## How to use this App?

- ### Drawing a sketch

Once loaded, ths screen should display **a canvas** to take some notes or draw a quick sketch by hand. You can change stroke width and color.

- ### Setting unit

By default, the measure unit is set on **'metre'** but you can convert the measures into **'cm'**, **'in'** or **'ft'**.

- ### Setting measures

You can then choose **a simple shape** and fill its measures in. For more complexe shapes or bigger project, you can add how many shapes as you wish. You can also delete any shape you don't need.
The sixth button allows you to add a custom area.

> Tips!
>
> You can deduce area surface (e.g. door or windows on walls) by setting **a negative measure**.
> *If the negative space is a square, you should set a rectangle with negative length or width.*

- ### Copying result

At any time the calculated total surface area can be copied to the clipboard.

- ### Setting Paint Project

If you activate Paint Project you should set the **coverage rate** of your paint and the **number of coats** you need. It will return an estimation of the necessary paint quantity.

- ### Printing results

At any time you can print out your project. A pdf will be downloaded on your device containing your sketch, the surface area and its details and the paint quantity.

> I hope it will be usefull for you!
